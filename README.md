# magical-voxel-3d-city-model

This is a collection of templates created for a game that never had life and that I have decided to make available to everyone without restrictions of use. The templates are created with magical voxel and can be imported simply by copying them into the software's VOX folder.

Models included:
* 3 types of bungalows
* 4 types of houses
* 4 types of hotels
* 2 types of offices
* 2 types of buildings
* 3 types of shops
 
 Models are all the same size usable in isometric and non-isometric tiles, they have already been tested in a prototype engine for positioning.
